I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Brazil, and I’ve taken a bit of an unconventional path to get here. I started my career as a tax lawyer, but my passion for tech eventually led me to make the leap into software development. I kicked things off in Frontend development, working with React and Vue, then transitioned into Backend. Now, I work across the full stack.

Along the way, I’ve also picked up experience in UI/UX design, blending creativity with technical know-how to build user-friendly and visually appealing solutions. I’m a self-learner at heart, driven by curiosity, motivation, and a good amount of persistence.

What I love most about this field is being able to use my creativity and hard work to collaborate with people from all over the world and contribute to projects that make a difference.
